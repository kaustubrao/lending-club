## General Information
- The aim of this project is to help the Lending Club reduce loan defaults without significantly leaving money on the table, i.e. denying legitimate customers loans they would be capable of paying back
- Loan data from 2008-2011 is available for this analysis, along with various attributes that can be used to identify drivers of default

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Loan grade, term of loan and interest rates are the biggest drivers of defaults
- Specifically, loans grades D,E,F, long term (60 month) loans and interest rates >15% are associated with very high default rates
- Users that have bankruptcies in the public record are also likely to have higher default rates 
- Loans that do not get funded (by investors) completely (funded to ratio <80%) also have a higher likelihood of default
